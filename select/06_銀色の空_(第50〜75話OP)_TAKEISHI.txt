Giniro no sora hatenai
Furitsuzuku netsu no youni
Mijikai kisetsu kaketeku
Bokura wo nurashite

The never-ending silver sky
Is like a continuous fever
The short season flies by
And soaks us

Nani mo motazu iku kara
Tayorinai te no hira ni
Madotte shimau yo

Whatever you will hold
In the palm of your forlorn hand
Will end your bewilderment

Yande shimatta ame ha
Kono sora ni itami sae
Nokosanai de

The weakening rain
Hasn't even left behind
The pain in this sky

Hikiau chikara to butsukeau omoi
Kizutsukete demo dakiyoseta
Kowaresouna kimi ni furete
Mienai mono shinjiteyuku

The power that draws you and the thoughts that you run into
Are painful, but embrace them
Moved by your vulnerability
I'm going to believe in the things that I can't see

Mou nani mo kowarenai yo
Fukinukeru netsu no youni
Mijikaku aoku kaketeku
Bokura wo yurashite

I will no longer be frightened of anything
As if I was blowing through the fever
The short paleness flies past
And sways us

Utsumuki nogashita no ha nanno yume?

Looking down, what kinds of dreams are escaping?

Oreyuku youna kirameki ga hoshii
Bokura ha ai wo shirinagara
Tadoritsukenai ka yowai hikari
Yoru ga akeru no wo matteru
